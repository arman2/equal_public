# User Study Data
We conducted a within-subject controlled experiment with 15 participants using eQual and GuideArch to measure:

whether users were more likely to produce higher-quality designs using GuideArch, eQual, or without any tool support; and whether the users preferred using GuideArch, eQual, or neither tool. Full details of this user study can be found in Section 4.3 and its pertinent data is located here.
