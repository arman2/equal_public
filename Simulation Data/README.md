# Sacalability Simulation Analysis
To evaluate eQual’s scalability, we used Google Compute Engine (GCE). We created 16 n1-standard-1 nodes (the most basic configuration available in GCE, with 1 vCPU and 3.75 GB RAM) as simulation nodes, and a single n1-standard-2 node (2 vCPU and 7.5 GB RAM) as the central controller node. All nodes were located in Google’s us-central1-f datacenter. We used the variation points and NFPs described in Section 3. The full details can be found in Section 4.4 of the paper. In short, we analyzed eQual’s scalability in terms of number of nodes, number of events, and number of variants. The data for these simulations is hosted here.
